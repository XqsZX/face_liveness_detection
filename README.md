# face_liveness_detection
The version1.0 is a face liveness detection with CNN and the accuracy is about 83%, the most important question is the val loss is too much than I guess. the formal one is the version1.0, I will change it to be better later
The version2.0 is a kind of failure, as you can see in the results, the accuracy is only 46%, in this version I change the CNN net to a complex one, maybe it is too complex for this model, I will change it in the next version.
